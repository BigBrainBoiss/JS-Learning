    <p class="basic">Stocks are essentially the whole business of buying a tiny part of a company in hopes that it will grow, the percentage that you bought of that company stays the same and so it will increase. The stock market is constantly peaking and volleying out overall is going upwards. Now as you can imagine it can be unwise to invest in a single new company as the likelihood of it becoming huge enough to make a decent profit is slim to none. What is a much better idea are index funds. Where you put a tiny bit of money across MANY companies that are usually selected for you or select from pre made packs of different stocks that you’ll be small amounts of money in. Then the goal is keep the money in all those companies balanced. That only means checking on it once and a while. 
      I bet there is some stuff I missed, but hopefully this helped.</p>

    <p class="STARTS">Personally i would wait until like summer of 2021, and do research on stocks and bonds and how they are valued, for the 9 months or so prior. Like look at what caused past recessions like the dotcom bubble, the housing crisis, or the great depression. One really good informative movie is “the big short”. I felt like that explained the housing crash very well. Also looking into what indicators signal recessions like, the bond yield curve inversion, or the unemployment rate. Faang stocks, and etfs are probably the best bet rn, if you don’t understand the market too well. you can invest in other things once you have been watching the market for awhile and understand it better. Rn is a weird time to start investing though and be wary of another market crash until probably summer 2021. I wouldn’t be surprised if there is another significant crash before that time. Definitely don’t do options though until you have at least a couple years normal investing. A lot of people get screwed in options. H<sub>2</sub>0

      That’s my 2 cents, but you can always develop your own strategy. I could go one for an hour, but I started about 6 months ago, and I’ve been looking at the market for a couple hours every day. Rn i have like 1/3rd of my portfolio in walmart and kroger. 1/3rd in Microsoft and google. Then the rest in cash. I’m thinking about putting money into silver as well since, there has been so much stimulus recently, and probably will be more. I’m only investing about $10,000 and so I’m not too into diversifying rn, but ik that is definitely a common strategy to use. I’ll definitely diversify though once i have more money in my account. So far those are the basics of what i’ve done to better understand stocks. It can take a bit of time to learn everything, but most terms can be learned by googling them, and once you understand how to invest it can be a great tool to increase your savings. It just takes a little time.

Block elements take a chunk of the page, while inline elements only take the space they need : Span = Inline , Div = block. Form tags wrap user input elements. You should not use the same id for different elements. They should be unique. An element can have multiple classes, it can be in the same string but should be seperated by a space
